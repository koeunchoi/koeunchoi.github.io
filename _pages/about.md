I am an [Associate Professor](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-human-development-and-family-science/faculty/koeun-choi.html) in the [Department of Human Development and Family Science](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-human-development-and-family-science.html/) at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University ([Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/)). My research group ([CoDeS Lab](http://kchoi.org/)) conducts research to understand how children learn in a complex and dynamic digital media environment.

As a developmental scientist, my transdisciplinary research program examines the role
of technology on cognitive development to better understand and support young children’s attention and learning in complex and dynamic technological landscapes. I leverage technological tools to enhance educational opportunities for children, including those who need them most. I focus on two complementary lines of research to identify the role of technology in young children’s cognitive development. The first area focuses on experimental research that examines children’s learning from interactive technology, which includes devices and systems that require active engagement from children to facilitate interaction and learning. The second area includes eye-tracking and correlational studies that investigate attentional processes and family contextual factors related to children’s technology use. I translate my research into practice to inform parents, educators, content creators, developers, health professionals, and policymakers about how to eﬀectively use technology to support children and their families.
